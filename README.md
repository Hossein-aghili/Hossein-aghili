# Hossein Aghili Attar 

(19 years old)

I’m Hossein Aghili Attar, and I started my journey in programming at the age of 16. My passion for technology and the things I heard from others motivated me to dive into programming, and I can confidently say that if I had the chance to go back 10 times, I’d still choose this path.

### 🎯 Goals

My main goal is to become a full-stack developer and master React, Node.js, and UI/UX Design. One of my biggest ambitions in life is to eventually start my own programming company. This is a major motivation and goal of mine.

### 🛠️ Skills

- JavaScript
- React
- Node.js
- UI/UX Design
- Next.js
- React Native
- Flutter (currently learning)

### 💻 Projects

1. E-Commerce Project  
   Currently working on a full-stack e-commerce project using React.js and Node.js. The project is near completion, with the UI/UX design almost finalized. This project will be a significant addition to my portfolio once completed.

2. Blog Full-Stack Project  
   Previously worked on a full-stack blog project, where I implemented both front-end and back-end features. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with full-stack development, including working with various APIs (mostly free-tier services) and handling backend logic.

3. Other React Projects  
   I’ve worked on various React-based projects, including e-commerce, sports, and blog platforms. Though these projects aren’t uploaded yet due to the usage of free-tier APIs, I plan to upload them soon.

4. JavaScript, React, and Node.js Challenge  
   I am currently working on a challenge consisting of:
   - 30 Vanilla JavaScript projects
   - 30 React mini-projects
   - 30 Node.js projects  
   I’m progressing step by step, and these projects will help me solidify my skills in JavaScript, React, and Node.js.

5. Flutter Learning  
   Currently diving into Flutter to expand my mobile app development skills. As I continue to learn, I plan to build projects to showcase my growing proficiency in this framework.
